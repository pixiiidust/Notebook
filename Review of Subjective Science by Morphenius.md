## Overview: A Promising Diagnosis—But the Cure Must Go Deeper

The essay asks the right questions. It challenges the limits of objectivity in science—particularly regarding subjectivity, here framed as reflexive domains like trauma, spirituality, and selfhood. The author’s sincerity and ambition to reclaim the “unscientific” are commendable.

But to move forward, the foundations must be stronger. What’s missing is a conceptual architecture: a way to frame subjectivity not as a separate category, but as a consequence of the objectives that define inquiry in the first place.

Let’s unpack this.

---

## 1. He Names the Disease but Not the Full Anatomy  
The essay rightly critiques the “objectivity trap”—the idea that what can’t be measured isn’t real. It encourages science to turn inward, toward belief systems, feedback loops, and inner transformation.

But it stops short of offering structure. The missing piece is a clear ordering of causes—which the author gestures toward but never formalizes.

To integrate the subjective and objective, we adopt the author’s Aristotelian causal hierarchy, which explains phenomena from top (most causal capacity) to bottom:

- **Final cause (telos):** the ultimate purpose or end  
- **Efficient cause:** the agent or paradigm acting toward that purpose  
- **Formal cause:** the frame of goal-directed pattern that defines logic  
- **Material cause:** the observable substrate

Without this hierarchy, science floats—clever but rootless. Subjective and objective modes aren’t separate types of knowledge, but positions within a layered causal chain. Their integration depends on ordering them rightly.

## 2. Subjectivity Is Not a Domain. It’s a Position in the Causal Chain  
The essay treats objectivity and subjectivity as distinct domains, each with separate methods. But this is a **category error**.

Subjectivity is not a method or field—it is a **relational position** within a causal hierarchy. It emerges from the lower causes (material, formal) and is shaped by the higher ones (efficient, final). In this structure, subjectivity and objectivity are not opposites, but modes governed by orientation to purpose.

Objective science arises when agential paradigms (efficient causes) are aligned with a discerned telos (final cause). A coherent “subjective science” must do the same. Without purpose, it drifts.

> **Science is always subjective—within the frame of its stated objectives.**

The issue isn’t a lack of subjective tools, but a lack of clarity around the *telos* that justifies the objective. Scientific aims are always sub-objectives within a larger causal chain.

Even physics—often considered the pinnacle of objectivity—rests on metaphysical assumptions: that the universe is intelligible, ordered, and stable. These are not empirical findings; they are **teleological commitments** that make science possible at all.

When these remain unexamined, science loses sight of its scaffolding. What appears as neutrality is often just unacknowledged fidelity to a hidden *telos*.

## 3. Wisdom Is the Right Ordering of Causes  
What the author hints at—but never quite names—is this:  
> **Wisdom is not the accumulation of truths, but the ability to order causes rightly.**

Reflexive phenomena—like selfhood, healing, or clarity—cannot be understood in isolation. They are expressions of **causal alignment or misalignment**, occurring at the level of agency (*efficient cause*).

Take trauma: to understand it is not to measure symptoms, but to trace how the agent loses connection to purpose (*final cause*), leading to distortion in form and degradation in matter.

A properly ordered causal chain brings this into focus:

- **Final** — purpose (e.g. flourishing, integration)  
- **Efficient** — agency (e.g. beliefs, interventions)  
- **Formal** — interpretive frame (e.g. concepts, archetypes)  
- **Material** — observable substrate (e.g. physiology, neural states)

The core issue in science is not the absence of subjective tools, but the absence of **diagnostic clarity**—the ability to justify *why* a given method or model is used in the first place. That justification requires knowing **where** the causal order has broken down—and how to restore it.

> This is the true task of applied science in lived experience:  
> **not to quantify the ineffable, but to align the intelligible.**

## 4. Reflexivity Is the Agency That Embodies Purpose  
The essay rightly highlights reflexivity—the fact that how we are seen shapes who we become—as central to human experience. But reflexivity is not a flaw in science; it belongs to a **higher order of causality**, one that **precedes** the scientific framework.

In Aristotelian terms, reflexivity is a form of **efficient cause**—agency in motion, directed toward a *telos* (final cause). The reflexive loop is not noise but **patterned action ordered by purpose**.

For any “subjective science” to mature, it must go beyond private phenomenology and root itself in a **relational teleological order**—a coherent chain linking subjective experience to objective form through successive causal dependencies.

Absent this, we relapse into the relativism of humorism, where every view becomes self-justifying and nothing can be falsified—because agency and purpose remain unexamined or wrongly subordinated to empirical method.

> Reflexivity becomes meaningful only when grounded in purpose.  
> Without this grounding, it masquerades as method—but drifts without direction.

---

## 5. Toward a Science of Wholesomeness  
The essay ends with a compelling but incomplete vision: a science of wisdom, compassion, and clarity.

It is a worthy dream. But dreams become reality only through structure. What is needed now is a **framework** where:

- **Objective and subjective** are not treated as competing domains, but as **modes within a causal hierarchy**  
- **Truth** is not defined solely by falsifiability, but by its **alignment with purpose**  
- **Science** is not a toolbox of methods, but a disciplined way of **ordering the world toward the good**

Only then can we build a science that heals without cursing, explains without flattening, and discovers without forgetting what it is *for*.

## 🧭 Comparison of the Four Causes (Top-Down Orientation)

| **Cause**         | **Role**                                | **Domain of Influence**                         | **Example**                                                  | **Relation to Subjectivity & Objectivity**                                      |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Final Cause**   | Purpose or end toward which something is directed | Direction, meaning, ultimate goal                | Human flourishing, justice, salvation, *telos* of a system     | Governs **objective orientation**; shapes all downstream logic and methods       |
| **Efficient Cause** | Agent or paradigm initiating change     | Action, agency, belief, responsive method         | Therapist’s intervention, decision to heal, gravity            | Seat of **subjective agency**; reflexive, shaped by and toward *final cause*     |
| **Formal Cause**  | Structure or formalized pattern for logic | Frame, concept, interpretive model               | Mathematical law, archetypes, diagnostic schema                | Conditions **intelligibility**; constrains what can be seen or inferred          |
| **Material Cause**| Physical substrate or observable base     | Matter, data, phenomena                          | Brain chemistry, blood pressure, neural signals                | What is **measured and observed**; basis for empirical claims                    |

### **Summary of Table**

- **Final → Efficient → Formal → Material**: a top-down flow of causality and meaning.  
- **Subjectivity** primarily arises at the **efficient** level (agency, reflexivity), governed by its alignment to the **final cause**.  
- **Objectivity** tends to operate through **formal and material** causes, but it too presupposes a purpose—whether explicit or hidden.

## Final Note  
This essay is a valuable step—lucid, sincere, and urgent. But the way forward lies not in multiplying methods, nor in simply validating subjectivity, but in **recovering wisdom**, as the author aptly intuits:  
> the capacity to order causes rightly,  
> so that science is no longer trapped in the basement of matter,  
> but ascends—integrated—toward the light of final purpose.
