### Overview: Decent Attempt to Structure "Thinking" Actionably: Gaps remain for presumptions in underlying framework

Inspired by *Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs*, *Wilber’s Integral Theory*/*Spiral Dynamics*, and *Piaget’s stages of psychosocial development*, **Hoe Math** presents a hierarchy of consciousness—mapping sociocultural evolution and individual cognition over time. The framework reinterprets this trajectory through a modern, possibly memetic lens. Below is a structured critical review of the model across three dimensions:

| Dimension             | Strength                                              | Core Weakness                                                                 |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Teleological Coherence | Development is purpose-driven and self-transcending   | No clear final cause or reason why this direction is necessary                 |
| Ontological Coherence  | Implies levels of being/knowing                       | No grounding in a metaphysical structure; lacks model of participation         |
| Temporal Fit           | Roughly tracks major civilizational epochs           | Imposes historicist linearity; ignores temporal cycles, recursions, and emergence frequency |

### 1. Teleological Coherence

**Does the model present a coherent direction of purpose or ultimate aim?**

### Strengths

* The model teleologically orients development upward: from survival to transcendence, from egocentric to world-centric consciousness.
* Later stages propose a return to stillness, care, and inter-being, suggesting a full circle—from reactive instinct to conscious observation.

### Critiques

* **Teleology lacks anchoring**: The top-level goal (“observe, understand, protect, honor…”) is admirable, but floats—it does not appear to be grounded in any ontologically necessary end, such as union with the absolute good or a transcendent logos.
* The model assumes *evolution = improvement* without clarifying what counts as “better.” There is no account of:

  * **Formal cause** (what defines the perfection of a stage), or
  * **Final cause** (why that perfection is desirable or necessary).
* The highest levels seem to revert to passive observation, which risks:

  * Dissolution of agency, or
  * Collapse into relativism, unless rooted in something higher than the self/world dialectic (e.g., anchored in teleological good or transcendental ethics).
* In short, there is no rational necessity to ascend—no account of **why** the higher stages *ought* to be pursued beyond their stated functions. Why this direction? Why this purpose?

### Comment

For a teleological model to be coherent, it must show not only a direction (from less to more complex), but also **why** that direction is worth following. A clear *telos*—such as the loving communion of the one and the many, divine likeness, or participatory harmony with the ground of being—is never fully stated.

### 2. Ontological Coherence

**Does the model present a stable metaphysical structure of what is real, and how knowing relates to being?**

### Strengths

* The progression from *instinct* to *ideology* to *integration* implies a growing alignment between perception and reality.
* The mention of *“observation without perspective”* at the top stage hints at a potentially apophatic or non-dual metaphysics.

### Critiques

* The model’s metaphysical ontology is either incoherent or absent:

  * Are these stages merely **constructs of cognition**, or do they reflect actual **ontological strata** of reality?
  * The use of terms like *“soul pathology”* vs. *“existential angst”* suggests a **layered ontology**, but this is never formalized.
* The model **conflates subjective development** (mental/emotional frameworks) with **collective social forms**, without clarifying how the two are causally linked. This implies a **weak doctrine of participation**—no strong claim is made about how **individual awareness shapes reality**, or how **reality conditions awareness**.
* The claim that **pathology varies by level** implies a **normative metaphysics**, yet there is no grounding in any **principle of being** (e.g., *logos*, divine order, or emergent structure).
* The levels lack **scalar invariance** combined with **goal-directed continuity**—there is no clear rational *throughline* connecting one stage to the next. Lower levels are not shown to be **constitutive parts** of higher levels (e.g., as proportion, echo, or *telic ratio*), weakening the internal logic of progression.

> For instance, HM's model mentions inspiration from Wilber’s Integral Theory—which borrows ontological tenets from eastern spirituality (in general, Sanatana Dharma) and Tibetan Buddhist metaphysics, which articulates nested scalar embodiments:
>
> * *Nirmāṇakāya* (the “transformation body”)
> * *Sambhogakāya* (the “enjoyment body”)
> * *Dharmakāya* (the “dharma body”)
>
> In this schema, higher levels **contain and transcend** lower ones. However, in **Hoe Math’s reinterpretation**, how structural embodiments are nested across increasing levels is not explicitly described—leaving the progression **abstract and ungrounded**.

### Comment

Ontological coherence requires clarifying whether development tracks **mental constructs** or **ontic states**, and whether higher stages reveal *more of what is*—or merely offer **more complex representational models**. Without this distinction, the system cannot claim **truth**, only **utility**. To justify its **metaphysical validity**, the model must articulate how each level **participates in** or **emerges from** a **coherent structure of being**.

### 3. Temporal-Structural Fit

**Does the historical mapping of social structures correspond to real cyclical rates, or is it artificially linear?**

### Strengths

* The timeline loosely aligns with known anthropological eras (e.g., tribal, empire, nation-state).
* Social structures are presented as embodiments of dominant consciousness, echoing frameworks from historical materialism and cultural evolution theory.

### Critiques

* The model treats history as a linear ascent, which:

  * Ignores cyclical dynamics (e.g., regressions, collapses, renewals).
  * Misses rate variability—some cultures may reach “green” before others leave “red,” or may embody multiple levels simultaneously.
  * Assumes uniform progress, when in reality development is nonlinear and often driven by crisis.
* There is no account of how frequently transitions occur. If a level’s emergence depends on a goal signal, then the rate of goal-signal resolution (or friction with reality) should modulate the timing of transitions.
* The framing lacks recursive embodiment—that is, how higher-level awareness folds back to shape lower-level behavior (as in governance, parenting, liturgy, etc.).

### Comment

A temporally coherent model should allow for oscillation, recursion, and rhythmic emergence—not merely a stepwise staircase. Incorporating transition rates, threshold triggers, and embodiment cycles would offer greater realism. Lower levels should involve shorter, recursive rate cycles aimed at “fruition” and “mastery,” scaling upward into longer developmental rhythms at higher levels.

###Suggested Framework Enhancements

1. Ground the top level in a transcendent attractor—not merely peace or “observation,” but a unitive source of being (e.g., the *Logos*, the *Tao*, or the *Good*).
2. Make explicit the ontological transition model—clarify whether the levels represent:

   * *Epistemic* shifts (a change in "how we know"),
   * *Ontological* stages (degrees of alignment, e.g. how teleological stages of "knowing" is "embodied" within reality -- i.e., realization in the eastern sense),
   * Or *Structural* changes (external institutions and systems--e.g. keeping records of what is done well, a lineage of traditions/accruing a knowledge base).
3. Introduce feedback cycles and phase shifts, perhaps through:

   * Rhythm-based goal convergence,
   * Entropy or pathology accumulation,
   * *Kairos*-based thresholds (as opposed to linear *chronos* time).
